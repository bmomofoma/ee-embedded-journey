# Embedded Systems Workspace

This repository is a technical workspace for developing and documenting competencies
in embedded firmware, digital logic design, PCB layout, and system-level analysis.
It serves as a central location for code snippets, experiments, and technical notes.

## Contents

- **Firmware & Embedded C experiments** – GPIO, timers, interrupts, PWM, communication protocols (UART, SPI, I²C, CAN)  
- **Digital Logic & Verilog** – combinational logic, sequential circuits, FSMs, simulation examples  
- **PCB Design & Hardware Notes** – schematics, KiCad layouts, Gerbers, BOMs, power management considerations  
- **MATLAB / System Analysis** – control systems, signal processing, RLC circuits, simulation scripts  
- **Documentation** – datasheets, application notes, block diagrams, timing diagrams, bring-up notes
