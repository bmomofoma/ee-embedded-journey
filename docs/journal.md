**Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Variables and Output

Worked on understanding and experimenting with basic data types in C, including:
- `int`
- `float`
- `char`
- character arrays (strings)

Practiced:
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Using `printf()` with format specifiers (`%c`, `%.2f`, `%s`)
- Writing and organizing comments
- Understanding how variables store values and how they are referenced during output

Created a simple C program that prints formatted output using multiple variable types.

**Focus:** C Programming — Format Specifiers, Arithmetic, and User Input

Practiced formatted output using field width and precision for floating-point values.
Explored arithmetic operators, highlighting the difference between integer and
floating-point division as well as the modulus operator.

Implemented user input handling using `scanf` and `fgets`, including clearing the
input buffer and safely processing string input.
