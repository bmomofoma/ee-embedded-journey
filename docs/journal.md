  **Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Variables and Output

  Worked on understanding and experimenting with basic data types in C, including:
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `char`
  - character arrays (strings)

  Practiced:
  - Declaring and initializing variables
  - Using `printf()` with format specifiers (`%c`, `%.2f`, `%s`)
  - Writing and organizing comments
  - Understanding how variables store values and how they are referenced during output

  Created a simple C program that prints formatted output using multiple variable types.

  **Focus:** C Programming — Format Specifiers, Arithmetic, and User Input

  Practiced formatted output using field width and precision for floating-point values.
  Explored arithmetic operators, highlighting the difference between integer and
  floating-point division as well as the modulus operator.

  Implemented user input handling using `scanf` and `fgets`, including clearing the
  input buffer and safely processing string input.

## December 30–31, 2025 (Catch-up)

  Worked through multiple C programming topics focusing on input/output,
  math functions, and small practice programs.

  ### Completed
  - Mad Libs program using `fgets` and formatted output
  - Shopping cart program practicing string input and numeric calculations
  - Circle calculator using `math.h` (`pow`) for area, surface area, and volume

  ### Key Concepts Practiced
  - Safe string input with `fgets`
  - Removing trailing newline characters
  - Format specifiers for integers and floating-point values
  - Mathematical computations using the C standard library
  - Basic program structure and documentation

  ### Notes
  Missed writing daily journal entries for these days, so this entry
  summarizes the completed work in one place.

## January 2 – Recovery Entry

  - What I worked on:
    - Finished conditionals folder (if / switch / calculator / converters)

  - What I understood well:
    - Control flow and branching is starting to feel natural

  - What felt confusing or tiring:
    - Feeling like I’m repeating basics and stuck in a loop

  - One honest thought:
    - Progress doesn’t always feel exciting, but I’m still moving forward.

  - Next concrete step (tomorrow):
    - Start functions and loops, one folder at a time

## January 3, 2026

  **Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Functions and Program Structure
    -Worked on understanding and applying functions in C, including:
    -Function declarations and definitions
    -Function prototypes
    -Return types and return values
    -Variable scope (local vs global)

  ## Practiced:
    -Breaking programs into reusable functions
    -Calling functions from main()
    -Passing arguments to functions
    -Using constants and mathematical functions (math.h)
    -Structuring programs for clarity and readability

  ## Created:
    -A circle calculation program using functions to compute area and circumference
    -A simple calculator program that performs arithmetic operations using function calls and a switch statement
    -Gained a clearer understanding of how functions improve code organization, readability, and maintainability, 
    and how C enforces structure through prototypes and scope rules.
