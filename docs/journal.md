**Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Variables and Output

Worked on understanding and experimenting with basic data types in C, including:
- `int`
- `float`
- `char`
- character arrays (strings)

Practiced:
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Using `printf()` with format specifiers (`%c`, `%.2f`, `%s`)
- Writing and organizing comments
- Understanding how variables store values and how they are referenced during output

Created a simple C program that prints formatted output using multiple variable types.

**Focus:** C Programming — Format Specifiers, Arithmetic, and User Input

Practiced formatted output using field width and precision for floating-point values.
Explored arithmetic operators, highlighting the difference between integer and
floating-point division as well as the modulus operator.

Implemented user input handling using `scanf` and `fgets`, including clearing the
input buffer and safely processing string input.

## December 30–31, 2025 (Catch-up)

Worked through multiple C programming topics focusing on input/output,
math functions, and small practice programs.

### Completed
- Mad Libs program using `fgets` and formatted output
- Shopping cart program practicing string input and numeric calculations
- Circle calculator using `math.h` (`pow`) for area, surface area, and volume

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Safe string input with `fgets`
- Removing trailing newline characters
- Format specifiers for integers and floating-point values
- Mathematical computations using the C standard library
- Basic program structure and documentation

### Notes
Missed writing daily journal entries for these days, so this entry
summarizes the completed work in one place.
