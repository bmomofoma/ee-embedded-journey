  **Focus:** C Programming — Format Specifiers, Arithmetic, and User Input

  Practiced formatted output using field width and precision for floating-point values.
  Explored arithmetic operators, highlighting the difference between integer and
  floating-point division as well as the modulus operator.

  Implemented user input handling using `scanf` and `fgets`, including clearing the
  input buffer and safely processing string input.
