## December 30–31, 2025 (Catch-up)

  Worked through multiple C programming topics focusing on input/output,
  math functions, and small practice programs.

  ### Completed
  - Mad Libs program using `fgets` and formatted output
  - Shopping cart program practicing string input and numeric calculations
  - Circle calculator using `math.h` (`pow`) for area, surface area, and volume

  ### Key Concepts Practiced
  - Safe string input with `fgets`
  - Removing trailing newline characters
  - Format specifiers for integers and floating-point values
  - Mathematical computations using the C standard library
  - Basic program structure and documentation

  ### Notes
  Missed writing daily journal entries for these days, so this entry
  summarizes the completed work in one place.
