## January 2 – Recovery Entry

  - What I worked on:
    - Finished conditionals folder (if / switch / calculator / converters)

  - What I understood well:
    - Control flow and branching is starting to feel natural

  - What felt confusing or tiring:
    - Feeling like I’m repeating basics and stuck in a loop

  - One honest thought:
    - Progress doesn’t always feel exciting, but I’m still moving forward.

  - Next concrete step (tomorrow):
    - Start functions and loops, one folder at a time
