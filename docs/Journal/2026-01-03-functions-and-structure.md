  **Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Functions and Program Structure
    -Worked on understanding and applying functions in C, including:
    -Function declarations and definitions
    -Function prototypes
    -Return types and return values
    -Variable scope (local vs global)

  ## Practiced:
    -Breaking programs into reusable functions
    -Calling functions from main()
    -Passing arguments to functions
    -Using constants and mathematical functions (math.h)
    -Structuring programs for clarity and readability

  ## Created:
    -A circle calculation program using functions to compute area and circumference
    -A simple calculator program that performs arithmetic operations using function calls and a switch statement
    -Gained a clearer understanding of how functions improve code organization, readability, and maintainability, 
    and how C enforces structure through prototypes and scope rules.
