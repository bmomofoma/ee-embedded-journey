  **Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Variables and Output

  Worked on understanding and experimenting with basic data types in C, including:
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `char`
  - character arrays (strings)

  Practiced:
  - Declaring and initializing variables
  - Using `printf()` with format specifiers (`%c`, `%.2f`, `%s`)
  - Writing and organizing comments
  - Understanding how variables store values and how they are referenced during output

  Created a simple C program that prints formatted output using multiple variable types.
