**Focus:** C Programming Fundamentals — Control Flow, Data Structures, Memory, and File I/O

Completed the remaining sections of a comprehensive C programming tutorial, covering intermediate and advanced concepts required for building non-trivial programs.

Worked on and studied:

### Control Flow
- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statements
- Nested conditionals
- Logical operators
- Ternary operator

### Loops & Program Flow
- `while` loops
- `for` loops
- Nested loops
- `break` and `continue`
- Random number generation

### Functions
- Function definitions and prototypes
- Return values
- Variable scope (local vs global)
- Using functions to structure programs logically

### Arrays & Data Handling
- One-dimensional arrays
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Arrays of strings
- Arrays combined with user input

### User-Defined Types
- `typedef`
- `enum`
- `struct`
- Arrays of structs

### Memory & Pointers
- Pointer fundamentals
- Pointer usage with arrays and structs
- Dynamic memory allocation:
  - `malloc`
  - `calloc`
  - `realloc`

### File Input / Output
- Writing data to files
- Reading data from files
- Understanding persistent storage in C programs

### Mini-Projects Completed
- Number guessing game
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Banking program
- Digital clock program

This phase completed my foundational C programming curriculum. I now have a solid understanding of how C programs are structured, how memory is managed, and how data flows through programs. This marks the transition point from general-purpose C programming to applying C in embedded systems and hardware-focused development.
